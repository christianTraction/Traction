# Quick Guide: Push to GitHub

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Traction`
3. Leave everything else as default (don't check any boxes)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. Look for the URL that looks like:
- `https://github.com/christianTraction/Traction.git` OR
- `git@github.com:christianTraction/Traction.git`

## Step 3: Tell Me the URL

Once you have the URL, I'll add it and push your code!

## Alternative: If You Already Have a Repo

Just tell me the URL and I'll push to it!
